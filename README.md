用于获取 主机浏览器 缓存中的用户名、密码  以及 svn等账户密码

Description
----
The __LaZagne project__ is an open source application used to __retrieve lots of passwords__ stored on a local computer. 
Each software stores its passwords using different techniques (plaintext, APIs, custom algorithms, databases, etc.). This tool has been developed for the purpose of finding these passwords for the most commonly-used software.

This project has been added to [pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy/) as a post-exploitation module. Python code will be interpreted in memory without touching the disk and it works on Windows and Linux host. The last Linux release is not up to date so I recommend using pupy to use it. 

Standalones
----
Standalones are now available here: https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/

Installation
----
Requirements are available here: https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/wiki/Requirements
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Usage
----
* Retrieve version
```
laZagne.exe --version
```

* Launch all modules
```
laZagne.exe all
```

* Launch only a specific module
```
laZagne.exe browsers
```

* Launch only a specific software script
```
laZagne.exe browsers -firefox
```

* Write all passwords found into a file (-oN for Normal txt, -oJ for Json, -oA for All).
Note: If you have problems to parse JSON results written as a multi-line strings, check [this](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/issues/226). 
```
laZagne.exe all -oN
laZagne.exe all -oA -output C:\Users\test\Desktop
```

* Get help
```
laZagne.exe -h
laZagne.exe browsers -h
```


* Change verbosity mode (2 different levels)
```
laZagne.exe all -vv
```

* Quiet mode (nothing will be printed on the standard output)
```
laZagne.exe all -quiet -oA
```

* To decrypt domain credentials, it could be done specifying the user windows password. Otherwise it will try all passwords already found as windows passwords. 
```
laZagne.exe all -password ZapataVive
```

__Note: For wifi passwords \ Windows Secrets, launch it with administrator privileges (UAC Authentication / sudo)__

Mac Os
----
__Note: In Mac OS System, without the user password it is very difficult to retrieve passwords stored on the computer.__ 
So, I recommend using one of these options

* If you know the user password, add it in the command line 
```
laZagne all --password SuperSecurePassword
```
* You could use the interactive mode that will prompt a dialog box to the user until the password will be correct 
```
laZagne all -i
```
